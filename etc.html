<h2>Finally,the Electron Transport Chain takes place in the inner membrane of the mitochondria.The NaDH and FDAH produced in earlier steps carry eletrons to the chain.These electron move throungh a series of poteins,pumping protons across the membrane and gennerating a proton a proton gradient.This energy is used to create  a large amount of ATP-about 32 to 34 molecules.Oxyen is essential in this step as the final acceptor,combinig with electrons and hydrogen ions to form water.</h2>
<br>
<h3>Altogether,cellular respiration can produce up to 36 to 28 ATP from one glucose molecule,making it a highly efficient way for cells to enery.</h3>
